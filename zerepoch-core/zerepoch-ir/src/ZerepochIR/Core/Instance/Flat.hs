{- Note: [Serialization of PIR]
The serialized version of Zerepoch-IR will be included in  the final
executable for helping debugging and testing and providing better error
reporting. It is not meant to be stored on the chain, which means that
the underlying representation can vary. The `Generic` instances of the
terms can thus be used as backwards compatibility is not required.
